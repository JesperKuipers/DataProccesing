# DataProccesing
<p>Welcome to my school project for the class dataproccesing.</p>

## Introduction
<p>This project is made for a school assignment where I needed to process data from a database to a consumer application.</p><br>
<p>The goal is to make a REST API that uses XML and JSON.
We need to make an application that uses the REST API, the apps need to switch between XML and JSON.</p>

## Database Import
<p>I downloaded the Dataset here: https://steam.internet.byu.edu/ </p>
<p>After downloading the dataset I found out that importing a 160Â GB dataset is a challenge in itself, not even talking about making a MySQL Dump into a working MS SQL Database.</p>

I used the following command to import it into PhpMyAdmin
```
mysql --init-command="SET SESSION FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0;" -u root -p DataBaseNamePlaceholder < C:\NameOfTheSqlFile
```
<br>
<p>But quickly switched to <a href="https://www.heidisql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HeidiSQL</a> mainly to check the progress. HeidiSQL also splits the file into multiple queries, see the GIF for an example.</p>

<p>The SQL file (160 GB) is to big even tho HeidiSQL splits the file into multiple queries.<br>
I solved this issue by using <a href="https://www.emeditor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EmEditor</a>. EmEditor is made to load big files and also works great to edit big files. But the feuture I used the most is the splitting tool, with this I was able to spilt the SQL file down in 8 files. Each file consist out of 1 table, except for some small tables.</p>

<p>With the smaller SQL files I was able to import the tables I need into MySQL with the help of HeidiSQL.</p>
